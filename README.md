Overview

  This project aims to analyze startup success and funding patterns in the U.S., uncovering key factors that influence outcomes such as acquisition, funding levels, and geographic clustering. By integrating startup     
  data with detailed ZIP code-level demographics and infrastructure data, we will explore how local economic and geographic conditions shape startup success. Through interactive visualizations, we will enable users to 
  dive into the data and gain actionable insights, catering to entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers.
